This is a Vue.js project done as a technical test.

I stumbled a bit and did not make it as far as I would have liked. Below is an outline of my process and thinking:
* Create a generic wireframe of the application based on the design in the prompt
* Include a Vue instance to get started
* I researched the chart.js and attempted to insert an example chart to begin. I couldn't get the chart to load and skipped this step for now. 
* Looked at the API and attempted to fetch the data once the Vue instance was created. I became stuck and was not getting the data I expected. I moved on and continued thinking
* I made some rough styling to the page to make it close to the prompt and easier to work with
* I discovered my mistake with the chart and was able to include a generic placeholder in the page
* I did not figure out the API in time and was left without a completed chart or fleshed-out Vue instance
